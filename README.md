CREDITS:
Please note that Jilles Miedema started developing an app for the HMS100 by HomeSeer. That app wasn't fully developed. It only included basic motion detection. It doesnt support the LUX nor the Temp. It didn't include the original manufacturer Express Controls either. They make other hardware that I will also add later. He did however pull together all of the settings for the device. I did post on his thread to see if he was developing and it appears he is not.

With that in mind, I decide it was better to create a new app for the actual manufacturer and have complete functionality of the device. I used his code as a base to understand the development. Then from there created new files with all of the excess trimmed and cleaned up.
